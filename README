Lets people pester you that you haven't done x task.
Uses taskwarrior.
I can't be bothered to style the input form properly right now, maybe later.
To setup:
sudo mkdir /opt/task/
sudo chown [USERNAME]:users /opt/task/
task push /opt/task/
then just 
task push /opt/task/
anytime to update the tasklist
